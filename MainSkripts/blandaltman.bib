abstract = {In an earlier Statistics Note1 we commented on the analysis of paired data where there is more than one observation per subject, as shown in table I. We pointed out that it could be highly misleading to analyse such data by combining repeated observations from several subjects and then calculating the correlation coefficient as if the data were a simple sample. This note is a response to several letters about the appropriate analysis for such data.
